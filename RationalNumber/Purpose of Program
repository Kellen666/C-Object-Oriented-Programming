Implement RationalNumber as a C++ class. 

A RationalNumber has two integer member variables. 
Call the member variables a (to mean the numerator) and b (to mean the denominator). 
Add the following member functions: 
o Default constructor:  set a = 0 and b = 1 
o Non-default constructors with only one argument: set a = the argument, and set b = 1 
o Non-default constructor with two arguments: set a and b to the argument values 
o Getters and setters: that return member variables and set the member variables 
o toDouble that returns the RationalNumber object as double 
o standardize as described in Week 1 Lab Work o reduce as described in Week 1 Lab Work 
 
Write a main program to test your function. 
You should be able to decide how many objects to create, what member functions to call,
and what kind of outputs should you display in order to convince yourself your class is well designed and well tested for correctness.
